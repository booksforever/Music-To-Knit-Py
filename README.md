# Music-To-Knit-Py
Creating knitting patterns from music

This is still in progress.  Currently, there will be no lace or cable patterns generated, merely textured ones.  Also, I am using music21, and have not tested with music other than the music found in the music21 corpus.

The program currently prints the pattern in the terminal, in the future it will output to a file for easier reading of the pattern.
